# Project Description
The Music Service database is a collaborative project between Chris Powell, Gary Yuen, Kolby Samson, Omed Mahshour, and myself. The project was the culmination of the work done through the quarter in the Database Systems course. 

The concept for the Music Service database was to simulate portions of a database that would be used within a music streaming service.  Music is a passion of mine, and was the main source of inspiration for working on this project. The project placed emphasis on the modeling of the database, table normalization, and thorough testing of the database tables and associated queries.

# Major Deliverables
-- Entity and Relationship Diagrams\
-- SQL statements\
-- Table queries and operations\
-- Discussion of normalization for each table\
